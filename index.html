    <h1>THE JINX BREAKER (PART 1)</h1>
    <Div id="intro">
        <p>I have always been in a group of people where new things started, where the ugly stopped and a new phase
            began.
        </p>
    </Div>
    <div class="container">
        <p>My first year in university was spent in the Nsukka Campus of the University of Nigeria. After the first
            year, we were to move to a different campus in Enugu known as University of Nigeria Enugu Campus(UNEC). We
            looked forward to 'crossing over' to UNEC, it was an achievement, because it was an upward movement not just
            associated with geographical change, but it shows you have successfully completed all first year courses
            without any failure. Only those who have passed all their courses could crossover
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>We heard so many stories about UNEC, the good and Ugly. One of the ugly stories we heard was that two students
        shared a bed space in the hostel in UNEC. My first year roommates would always tease me to tell me how I would
        leave Nsukka where I had a bed to myself, to a place where I would sleep on the same bed with another female
        studentâ€¦awfulðŸ˜­.. We were told the hostel was overpopulated and that was the only way to manage the over
        population. We were also told UNEC students were very untidy and their bed spreads were always dirtyâ€¦
    </p>
    <p>I will never sleep on the same bed with a stranger, before I cross over, the school management would change that
        policy! This was my reply to my roommates in Nsukka each time they came up with those ugly stories. They would
        laugh at me and say I was just dreaming ðŸ¤£. I didnt know what gave me the guts but I kept speaking what I wanted
        to see, you could call it dreams or denying the obvious, but I refused to accept that ugly situation for myself.
        In reality I didn't know how the change would happen, but I kept speaking about the change I wanted to see.
    </p>
    <p>We eventually crossed over to UNEC and that same year, the school management abolished the unhealthy system of
        two students sharing the same bed. It happened the way I said it. You may call it coincidence, but I believe
        what I spoke came to manifestation. My set was the end of that Jinx. A new phase of hostel management began with
        us. Each female student had a bed space to herself.
    </p>
    <p>You may not have the power to change all things around you, but you still have the power to dream and have a
        positive mindset towards things. Dreams they say come true. It doesn't hurt to dream, dream big, dream positive.
        Refuse to accept the ugly status quo. Even if it doesn't happen your way, at least you tried!
    </p>
